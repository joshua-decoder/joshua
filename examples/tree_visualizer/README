These examples demonstrate how to use the tree visualizer.  
Build the visualizer by running the following commmand in the
$JOSHUA directory:

    ant tree_visualizer

You can run the visualizer by using the visualizer invocation 
script under UNIX/Linux/OS-X:

    tree_visualizer.sh tree.fr tree.ref tree.en

or under Windows:

    tree_visualizer.cmd tree.fr tree.ref tree.en

Click on the sentence that displays, and you will be presented
with the visualization in a second window.
