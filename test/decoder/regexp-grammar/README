This test tests the use of regular expressions in the grammar.  This is an experimental feature with
an inefficient implementation in the decoder, but there are a number of things that could be done to
make it more efficient if the technique proves useful.

To enable it, you set the Joshua parameter

  regexp-grammar = OWNER

where OWNER is the owner of one or more grammars whose rules might be interpreted as regular
expressions.
