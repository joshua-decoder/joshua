Thrax uses Apache hadoop (an open-source implementation of MapReduce) to
efficiently extract a synchronous context-free grammar translation model
for use in modern machine translation systems.

Thrax currently has support for both Hiero-style grammars (with a single
non-terminal symbol) and SAMT-style grammars (where non-terminal symbols are
calculated by projecting onto the span from a target-side parse tree).

COMPILING:

First, you need to set two environment variables:
$HADOOP should point to the directory where Hadoop is installed.
$AWS_SDK should point to the directory where the Amazon Web Services SDK
is installed.

To compile, type

    ant

This will compile all classes and package them into a jar for use on a 
Hadoop cluster.

At the end of the compilation, ant should report that the build was successful.

RUNNING THRAX:
Thrax can be invoked with

    hadoop jar $THRAX/bin/thrax.jar <configuration file>
