3.1.1
-----
- Fixed race condition in checking for new sentences in translateAll()

- Added removal of unary abstract rules to grammar filtering steps
  (important since Joshua does not at the moment properly handle unary
  chains when decoding)


3.1
---
- Fixed multithreading.  Use -threads N from the command line or
  configuration file to spawn N parallel decoding threads.

- Configuration file parameters can now be overridden from the command
  line.  The format is

  -parameter value

  Among these must be the configuration file itself, which can be
  referred to with -config, or -c for short.

---

- Added the highly parameterizable Hadoop-based Thrax grammar
  extractor, which extracts both Hiero and SAMT grammars.

- Incorporated a black-box pipeline script at
  $JOSHUA/scripts/training/pipeline.pl
