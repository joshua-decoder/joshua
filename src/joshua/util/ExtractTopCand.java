   * <ol>
   * <li>all translations for a segment are contiguous</li>
   * <li>the 1-best translation is the first one encountered.</li>
   * </ol>
   * We will need to alter the implementation if these assumptions no longer hold for the output of
   * JoshuaDecoder (or any sensible n-best format passed to this method).
   * <p>
   * We should switch to using an n-best {@link joshua.decoder.segment_file.SegmentFileParser} to
   * ensure future compatibility with being able to configure the output format of the decoder. The
   * MERT code needs such a SegmentFileParser anyways, so that will reduce the code duplication
