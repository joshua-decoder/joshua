     * What is the algorithm?
     * 
     * Take the first word of the sentence, and start at the root of the trie. There are two things
     * to consider: (a) word matches and (b) nonterminal matches.
     * 
     * For a word match, simply follow that arc along the trie. We create a parallel arc in our
     * filtered grammar to represent it. Each arc in the filtered trie knows about its
     * corresponding/underlying node in the unfiltered grammar trie.
     * 
     * A nonterminal is always permitted to match. The question then is how much of the input
     * sentence we imagine it consumed. The answer is that it could have been any amount. So the
     * recursive call has to be a set of calls, one each to the next trie node with different
     * lengths of the sentence remaining.
     * 
     * A problem occurs when we have multiple sequential nonterminals. For scope-3 grammars, there
     * can be four sequential nonterminals (in the case when they are grounded by terminals on both
     * ends of the nonterminal chain). We'd like to avoid looking at all possible ways to split up
     * the subsequence, because with respect to filtering rules, they are all the same.
     * 
     * We accomplish this with the following restriction: for purposes of grammar filtering, only
     * the first in a sequence of nonterminal traversals can consume more than one word. Each of the
     * subsequent ones would have to consume just one word. We then just have to record in the
     * recursive call whether the last traversal was a nonterminal or not.
