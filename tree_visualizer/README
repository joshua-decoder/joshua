Build the visualizer by running the following commmand in the
$JOSHUA directory:

ant tree_visualizer

You can run the visualizer by using the visualizer invocation 
script under UNIX/Linux/OS-X:

tree_visualizer.sh tree.fr tree.ref tree.en

or under Windows:

tree_visualizer.cmd tree.fr tree.ref tree.en

Click on the sentence that displays, and you will be presented
