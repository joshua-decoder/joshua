/**
 * This interface represents a collection of constraints for a given span in the associated segment.
 * Intuitively, each constraint corresponds to one or more items in the chart for parsing, except
 * that we pre-seed the chart with these items before beginning the parsing algorithm. Some
 * constraints can be "hard", in which case the regular grammar is not consulted for these spans. It
 * is an error to have hard constraints for overlapping spans.
 * <p>
 * Indices for the span boundaries mark the transitions between words. Thus, the 0 index occurs
 * before the first word, the 1 index occurs between the first and second words, 2 is between the
 * second and third, etc. Consequently, it is an error for the end index to be equal to or less than
 * the start index. It is also an error to have negative indices or to have indices larger than the
 * count of words in the segment. Clients may assume that no <code>ConstraintSpan</code> objects are
 * constructed which violate these laws.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Segment}, {@link ConstraintSpan}, and {@link ConstraintRule} interfaces are for
 * defining an interchange format between a SegmentFileParser and the Chart class. These interfaces
 * <emph>should not</emph> be used internally by the Chart. The objects returned by a
 * SegmentFileParser will not be optimal for use during decoding. The Chart should convert each of
 * these objects into its own internal representation during construction. That is the contract
 * described by these interfaces.
