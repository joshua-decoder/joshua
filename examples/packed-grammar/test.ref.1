scientists decrypted the sequence of a chromosome crucial to symptoms of early disorders
( agence france-presse , paris , 2nd ) - an international consortium of scientists said that they have decrypted the sequence of the fourteenth pair of human chromosome , which is linked to a broad range of diseases , including an early onset of alzheimer that can strike people in their 30s .
this is the fourth chromosome to be fully sequenced up till now and it comprises of over 87 million pairs of deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) .
the research , which was published in the weekly british science journal nature , said the sequence of chromosome 14 is made up by 1,050 genes and gene fragments .
the goal of gene scientists is to provide diagnostic tools to identify flawed genes that cause illness , and ultimately to provide treatments , which can stop these genes from malfunctioning .
