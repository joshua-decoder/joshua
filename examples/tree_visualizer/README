These examples demonstrate how to use the tree visualizer.  
Build the visualizer by running the following commmand in the
$JOSHUA directory:

    ant

You can run the visualizer by using the visualizer invocation 
script under UNIX/Linux/OS-X:

    $JOSHUA/scripts/analysis/tree_visualizer tree.fr tree.ref tree.en

or under Windows:

    tree_visualizer.cmd tree.fr tree.ref tree.en

To invoke the tree visualizer, you need at least three arguments:

1) a file with source sentences, one per line
2) a file with reference translations, one per line
3) an n-best file like the one produced by Joshua.

Note that the n-best file needs to have source-aligned derivation trees, so
you should run the Joshua decoder with use_tree_nbest = true and
include_align_index = true.

Additional arguments should be more n-best files to compare to the first one.

Click on the sentence that displays, and you will be presented
with the visualization in a second window.
