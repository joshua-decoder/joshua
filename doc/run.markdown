Get started with Joshua                                {#run}
=======================

\tableofcontents

This document gives instructions on how to get started using the Joshua 
decoder. Joshua is an open-source decoder for parsing-based machine 
translation. Joshua uses the synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) formalism 
in its approach to statistical machine translation, and the software implements 
the algorithms that underly the approach.

These instructions will tell you how to:

* Install the software
* Prepare your data
* Create word alignments
* Train a language model
* Extract a translation grammar
* Run minimum error rate training
* Decode a test set
* Recase the translations
* Score the translations
