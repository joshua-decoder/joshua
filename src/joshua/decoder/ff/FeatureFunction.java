/**
 * This class defines is the entry point for Joshua's sparse feature implementation. It defines some
 * basic variables and interfaces that are common to all features, and is immediately inherited by
 * StatelessFF and StatefulFF, which provide functionality common to stateless and stateful
 * features, respectively. Any feature implementation should extend those classes, and not this one.
 * 
 * Features in Joshua work like templates. Each feature function defines any number of actual
 * features, which are associated with weights. The task of the feature function is to compute the
 * features that are fired in different circumstances and then return the inner product of those
 * features with the weight vector. Feature functions can also produce estimates of their future
 * cost; these values are not used in computing the score, but are only used for pruning. The
 * individual features produced by each template should have globally unique names; a good
 * convention is to prefix each feature with the name of the template that produced it.
