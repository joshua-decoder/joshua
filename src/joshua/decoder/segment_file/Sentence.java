   * The distinction between sequenceId and id is important. The former is the identifier assigned

   * sentences themselves can claim to be whatever number they want (for example, if wrapped in <seg
   * id=N>...</seg> tags). It's important to respect what the sentence claims to be for tuning
   * procedures, but the sequence id is also necessary for ensuring that the output translations are
   * assembled in the order they were found in the input file.

   * In most cases, these numbers should be the same.
